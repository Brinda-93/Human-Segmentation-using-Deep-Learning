# Deep Learning with PyTorch - Image Segmentation

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for image segmentation using Deep Learning with PyTorch. The notebook provides an end-to-end workflow, including data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Features
- **Data Preparation**: Loading and preprocessing images for segmentation tasks.
- **Model Architecture**: Implementation of deep learning models such as U-Net or DeepLabV3.
- **Training & Evaluation**: Training the model using PyTorch, monitoring performance, and evaluating results.
- **Visualization**: Displaying segmentation masks and model predictions.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn tqdm
```

Additional dependencies may be required depending on the dataset used.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Deep_Learning_with_PyTorch_ImageSegmentation.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the notebook cells to run the segmentation pipeline.

## Dataset
Ensure that your dataset is properly formatted. The notebook may require modifications based on your dataset structure. If using a public dataset, download it and update the data paths accordingly.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:
- **Intersection over Union (IoU)**
- **Dice Coefficient**
- **Pixel Accuracy**

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute by improving the model, adding more datasets, or optimizing performance. Fork the repo and submit a pull request!
